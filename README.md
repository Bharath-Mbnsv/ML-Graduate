# ML-Graduate
Prospective graduate students always face a dilemma deciding universities of their choice while applying to master's programs. While there are a good number of predictors and consultancies that guide a student, they aren't always reliable since decision is made on the basis of select past admissions. In this project, we present a Machine Learning based method where we use different algorithms, such as Random Forest, SVM, Linear Regression, given the profile of the student to predict colleges based on their profile. We then compute error functions for the different models and compare their performance to select the best performing model. Results then indicate if the university of choice is an ambitious or a safe one. Using this method user can enter Various factors as input like GRE , TOFEL, B.Tech percentage, term applying for , total technical papers published. Based on these features machine learning model can be selected and predictions of which college is possible for applying for MS is calculated and displayed to user. Along with these details students can look after students who have applied for universities based on their marks and status from university.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91474925/183517138-d8993c18-708a-43d3-b578-3c604807a189.png)
